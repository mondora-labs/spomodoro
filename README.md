Spomodoro
===============

This is the Spomodoro App. It is easy right now.

Things to implement:

- first pomodoro (2 pomodoro)     
- pause message and sound (1 pomodoro)
- kanban pomodor style (4 pomodoro)


To test the application your Spotify account needs to have the developer flag
set. You can find out how to activate the developer flag [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account).

Clone this repository in your Spotify workspace directory. If you haven't got a Spotify directory, read about where to create it [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/#creatinganapp). Cloning will create a subfolder called boilerplate-app. 

You can access the application (restart the Spotify desktop client if you have not done so) by typing in spotify:app:boilerplate-app in the search field.
Read more about this in the [Spotify Developer Guidelines](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/).

In turn, main.js loads  four script files, each showcasing a part of the Spotify Apps API.
